## Introduction
Hi! This is a little project I'm working on to learn OpenGL. To do so, I decided to follow <a src="https://learnopengl.com/">this website</a>. There should be in my git history a progression of the steps I took to learn this new technology.

## Dependencies

You will need to download the lastest version of 
* GLFW
* GLEW
on your machine.

The repo also requires submodules. Don't forget to install those.
